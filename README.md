## Free Alpine Mind website
### My first website for The Czechitas online workshop.

https://freealpineminds.netlify.app/

Intensive three months-long Front-end development course, 10/2020 - 12/2020.

I learned mainly:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Sass**
- **BEM**
- **Markdown**
- **UX**
- **FIGMA**
- **GitHub**

Technologies used - Node.js, Eleventy, Netlify.

The site is about travelling. Thanks Kriss and Jakub for providing the content (photos and texts) and for helping with UX testing and bringing information during endless discussions about what the web should look like. 

The process of building this website:
1. Website designs (pencil, crayons, block).
1. Rewritten to FIGMA - prototype.
1. UX part - a scenario for testing, selection of respondents, execution of the test.
1. Incorporating user feedback into the design.
1. Setting up the project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Preparation of the material - especially photos, rewriting the text.
1. Web structure - transfer to HTML.
1. Styling using CSS, BEM method and Sass (which is brilliant).
1. Intensive adjustments, hours of testing, changes.
1. Creating subpages and templates.
1. Consultation with my Coach Jirka Semler, in-corporation of third-party JS code into the project into the main page (carousel) - also thanks to Jirka for his help and patience!
1. Uploading the project to Netlify.

I started construction on **November 9, 2020,** and submitted the project to the exam on **December 4, 2020** - 4 weeks.

The things I enjoyed about this project the most were UX design, test preparation, communication with respondents. CSS pre-processor Sass helped me reduce code repetetion and improve code readability. 

 I am planning to redesign the whole project to incorporate all the new skills and best practices I have learned since - including my own JavaScript code.
